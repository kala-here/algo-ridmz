# Merging 2 Packages
# Given a package with a weight limit and an array of item weights, implement a function getIndicesOfItemWeights that finds two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit. Your function should return a pair [i, j] of the indices of the item weights, ordered such that i < j. If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist, return an empty array.

# Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution.

def get_indices_of_item_weights(arr, limit)
  # your code goes here
end
